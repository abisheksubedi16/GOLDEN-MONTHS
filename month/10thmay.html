<p class="firstp">It is the 10<sup>th</sup> of May and the 27<sup>th</sup> of Baisakh. Not only that, today marks one month since our chat began.</p>
<p class="secondp">We started talking a long time ago, but it was just casual conversation between friends. After our SEE exams, we started talking more and now I know who you are. Our chat started when I asked about the trek video and the next day, I asked about the song you mentioned on the bus ride back from the trek. Since then, we've had many conversations and have become good friends. I don't know where I stand in your friend group, but you're at the top of mine. I may have made you angry at times, but I hope we've resolved those issues. I also hope that I don't bore you with my messages.</p>
<p class="thirdp">We have had many serious, funny and joke-filled conversations between us. You have shared many of your things and I have shared mine as well. At first, we only chatted, but after some time we started talking on the phone. We have even met at school and started planning our meetings.</p>
<p class="fourthp">As I have told you in our chats, you are a very special person in my life. There's always a fear because of you, which you are also aware of. We have both handled many people who have had misunderstandings between us. I know it can be stressful to handle them, but we have been managing them till now.</p>
<p class="fifthp"> our friendship has come a long way from casual chats to phone calls and even face-to-face meetings. We have shared serious and funny moments, as well as handled misunderstandings with maturity and grace. I cherish the special bond we have built over time and hope that it continues to grow stronger. You have been a valuable friend to me and I want you to know that I appreciate your presence in my life. Thank you for being such an amazing friend and I look forward to more memories with you in the future.</p>
