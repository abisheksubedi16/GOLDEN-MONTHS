    <blockquote><center>
<p class="firstp">It is the 10<sup>th</sup> of Jul and the 27<sup>th</sup> of Ashar. Not only that, today marks three month since friendship began.</p>
<p class="secondp">Today is a special day because we've been friends for three months now, and we've had so many wonderful moments together. As we enter our third month of friendship, I'm really excited to make our bond even stronger. We've had some really amazing experiences that we'll never forget, and some of them even made us cry. We've also had a few arguments, but they've actually made our friendship even stronger. Let's keep taking care of our friendship and making more great memories together.</p>
<p class="thirdp">During these past three months, we have shared countless joyful experiences and also weathered moments of sadness together. We have met three times by making secret plans and visited Lakeside for two days, as well as Devis Fall and Guptashor Cave for one day, which was very fun and enjoyable.I pranked you by saying I will read 11 and 12 in GBS, which was also a very fun moment for me (not for you, I guess). When we were returning from Lakeside, I told you it was a lie, and you were happad(happy+sad). If the prank had been completed, it would have been even more fun, but it's fine.On the same day, we briefly met at Bhatbhateni, which was also fun despite the short period of time. I genuinely hope that these wonderful dynamics continue to shape our future. We have openly shared our thoughts, feelings, and personal stories, which has undoubtedly fortified the foundation of our friendship. I sincerely hope that you will continue to support me in further strengthening this bond.</p>
<p class="fourthp">During these three months, we have planned big things for the future, Named <a href="#" onclick="loco()">Loco</a> Trip to go Mustang, which we are determined to make possible for sure. 
    I made myself cry once by thinking that we would stop talking after you go to Australia, but you said we would keep in touch, and it made me feel good.
    I genuinely hope that these delightful elements continue to sprinkle our future interactions, adding warmth and familiarity to our
      friendship.</p>
<p class="fifthp">I fervently hope that the beautiful tapestry of our friendship extends its embrace to Pari, Advo,Adri and Aakriti. May the continuity of our shared
     experiences, filled with laughter, support, and understanding, envelop them as well. Just as we have nurtured our bond with care, let us extend the same warmth 
     and inclusivity to our dear friends Pari, Advo,Adri and Aakriti. Together, may we create an unbreakable friendship that lasts forever.</p>
