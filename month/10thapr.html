            <p class="firstp">It is the 9<sup>th</sup> of April and the 27<sup>th</sup> of Chaitra. Not only that, today
                marks one year since friendship began.</p>
            <p class="secondp">
                Today marks a beautiful milestone, for it's been a year since our friendship began blooming, adorned
                with countless treasured moments. As we embark on this new chapter, my heart brims with excitement at
                the thought of strengthening the bond we cherish. Through laughter-filled adventures and heartfelt
                conversations, we've woven a tapestry of shared experiences. Even moments of disagreement have only
                deepened the authenticity of our connection. I eagerly look forward to nurturing our friendship and
                creating even more unforgettable memories together.</p>
            <p class="thirdp">
                Over the past year, our journey has been adorned with countless shared joys and the comforting solace of
                companionship during moments of sorrow. I am deeply grateful for the openness with which we've shared
                thoughts, emotions, and personal anecdotes. School life transformed into a cherished chapter with you by
                my sideâ€”it was a medley of laughter and tears, a symphony of shared experiences.

                Our friendship blossomed further as we delved into school projects and adventures together. From
                attending computer courses to accompanying each other to the bus station, our bond only grew stronger.
                We explored various places with your brother, sharing countless pranks and moments of pure joy.

                As our friendship evolved, we found ourselves confiding in each other at a level akin to that of
                couples. After several months, your heartfelt confession of love marked the beginning of our official
                journey as a couple. Despite occasional disagreements, our commitment to each other never wavered, and
                we weathered every storm together.

                Our openness as a couple led us to share intimate conversations and moments of affection, from heartfelt
                talks to stolen kisses and warm hugs. Whether it was sneaking kisses in the school staircase or enjoying
                movie dates with your brother, every moment felt like a treasure.

                Our unwavering bond has truly strengthened the foundation of our friendship, and I eagerly anticipate
                your enduring support as we continue to nurture and enrich this precious connection. Together, I believe
                we are the best couple in the world.
            </p>
            <p class="fourthp">My fervent wish is for our beautiful tapestry of love and friendship to gracefully
                include Aakriti, Advo, Pari, Paru, Kutti, Bakwas Ladki, Badarni, Wifiee, Sanu, Priyee, Mutu, and all
                those dear to us. May the ongoing story of our shared journey, filled with laughter, unwavering support,
                and deep understanding, wrap them in its comforting embrace. Just as we've nurtured our own bond with
                care, let's extend that same radiant warmth and inclusivity to our cherished friend. Together, let's
                weave a bond so strong, so enduring, that its resonance echoes through eternity.</p>
