<p class="firstp">It is the 10<sup>th</sup> of Jun and the 27<sup>th</sup> of Jestha. Not only that, today marks two month since friendship began.</p>
<p class="secondp">Today is a special day because we've been friends for two months now, and we've had so many wonderful moments together. As we enter our second month of friendship, I'm really excited to make our bond even stronger. We've had some really amazing experiences that we'll never forget, and some of them even made us cry. We've also had a few arguments, but they've actually made our friendship even stronger. Let's keep taking care of our friendship and making more great memories together.</p>
<p class="thirdp">In the last two months, we've had so many happy times together, but we've also faced some tough moments. We worked together as a team when we had a problem and found a solution, which showed how strong our friendship is. I really hope that these positive experiences continue to shape our future. We've been open with each other, sharing our thoughts, feelings, and personal stories, which has made our friendship even stronger. I sincerely hope that you'll keep supporting me as we continue to strengthen our bond. Can I rely on your partnership in this journey?</p>
<p class="fourthp">In our daily chats, we've used a lot of fun emojis like 😂 🤣 🤦‍♂️ 😶 🙂 😴 🥱 🙄🙃 😭 😬 👊, and they've become a memorable part of our conversations. We've also shared comforting phrases like "good night," "good morning," "mai challw," "achaa achaa," "han ji," "good good," and many more. I really hope that we keep using these delightful elements in our future interactions, as they bring a sense of warmth and familiarity to our friendship.</p>
<p class="fifthp">I really hope that our wonderful friendship includes Pari, Advo, and Aakriti too. Let's make sure they feel the same laughter, support, and understanding that we've experienced together. Just as we've taken care of our bond, let's also extend warmth and inclusiveness to our dear friends. Together, we can create a strong friendship that lasts forever.</p>
