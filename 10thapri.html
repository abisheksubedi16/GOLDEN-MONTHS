            <p class="firstp">It is the 9<sup>th</sup> of April and the 27<sup>th</sup> of Chaitra. Not only that, today
                marks two year since friendship began.</p>
            <p class="secondp">
                Baby, today is not just another day—it's a special moment that reminds me how far we’ve come together.
                It’s been two beautiful years since our friendship started turning into something so deep, so real, and
                so full of love. From the very beginning, you’ve been my comfort, my peace, my reason to smile. We’ve
                shared so many little and big things—school days, crazy laughs, emotional talks, fun adventures, and
                even those sweet little fights that brought us closer. Babe, I love you so much, and I will always be
                yours, no matter what.</p>
            <p class="thirdp">
                Paru, every moment we spent together feels like a dream I never want to end. I still remember the way we
                laughed on scooter rides and how we enjoyed school tours on the bus, sitting close, smiling without
                saying a word. Every ride, every place we explored together—even chotu, Raja-hindustani, Toda Mart—holds a
                memory that I’ll never forget. You made the boring days exciting and the good days even better. From our
                mini dates, secret kisses, warm hugs to those small looks we shared in silence—it all felt like
                something out of a beautiful story. You turned my normal school life into something magical, something
                full of love and meaning.
            </p>
            <p class="fourthp">Xuku, as we move forward together, I just want you to know how deeply I care for you. I
                want to keep making memories, keep loving you more every day, and keep growing together through
                everything life throws at us. I love the way you laugh, the way you get shy, and even the way you get
                mad at times—it’s all so special to me. Mutu, I promise to always stand by your side, to support you,
                hold you close, and never let go. You are not just my girlfriend—you are my best friend, my safe space,
                my forever person. I truly believe we are the best couple in the world. I love you endlessly, and I’ll
                keep loving you in every lifetime. Always and forever, I’m yours.❤️</p>
